Fruit tech is an African based start up which has the intention of exploring 
the different feilds of tech with IoT and *important* software leading the path. 
The companes name Friuit Tech comes from the variety that fruits bring, there are different 
kinds of fruit with some being nice and others not the great according to your taste. We look foward to having 
a hands on different forms of tech creating a variety in our products.

We believe in *Open Source* with this site is an example of this, we are also willing to invest in 
other African based start ups to conribute to the growth of the tech industry in Africa.
There is no way to sell your products to a target market which has no or little knowledge on it,
the I.CT litracy rate is low in the African continent and due to this we set out o tech
the internet in the coming future. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a step, in this line a journey that will
strech across generations to come starts here.
